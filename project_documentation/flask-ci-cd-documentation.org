This is a simple CI/CD project to showcase my skills in ....

It's aim is for someone to be able to download this repository and run it
himself to create a working CI/CD pipeline in AWS based on Jenkins
that deploys a container with a flask web app to AWS each time a
commit is made to the tracked flask app repository. 


* DONE Fork the simple Python Flask web application.

** Exploring tutor's choice of the app. Reading about Corey Schafer on his blog, https://coreyms.com
This app was committed as a whole, with several distinct stages. I'm
going to use the stages as basis of separate commits for testing of
the pipeline and in the beginning only commit the first stage.

** Created a new repository, copied contents of the first chapter from Flask_Blog tutorial.
Flask Blog code found at [[https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Python/Flask_Blog][this address]].
Copied .gitignore from the CI/CD repo, but added the name of directory
with the original Corey's repo files, so they wont all get committed
at once.

* DONE Create a separate repository for Jenkins provisioning, installation, and configuration.

* DONE Set up Jenkins part 1: setting up a VM on AWS using Terraform.
CLOSED: [2023-07-21 Fri 14:54]
** Create a data source that gets the AMI of the latest Alma Linux 9
** Create a base main.tf file that is a copy from the Terraform Up and Running code. Also add an alternative version that was given as an example of Jenkins setup on AWS.
** Add definitions for basic VPC and subnet
** Modify the basic security group definition to allow incoming traffic on ports 22 (for SSH) and 8080 (Jenkins web app)
** Move some values to variables to make code cleaner and reusable or usable by people who choose to use different AWS region
*** Move the port values to a variable and use variables instead.
*** Move the EC2 instance type to a variable (eu-north-1 region requires usage of a non standard t3 type server)
*** Move the region name to a variable.
** Create a script to create and open/close LUKS container (which can hold the SSH key).
** Write out pseudocode for a script that would execute the whole project.
** Put the initial steps (vault creation, SSH key generation and uploading and Jenkins VM spin up) into the playtrough script.
*** 1: Vault creation - done
*** 2: SSH key generation - done
*** 3: SSH key uploading & VM spin up - need to finish some things first:
**** Find a way to make the EC2 instance accessible from the internet (can't access it now if I'm creating my own subnet)
**** Find a way to pass the IP address of the EC2 instance to Ansible
** Had some issues with creating a VM accessible from the outside. Followed a blog article tutorial and succeeded, need to take what I learned there and put it in my Terraform code.
Following instructions in the [[https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-manage-public-and-private-subnets-in-aws-with-terraform-69c272003c81][blog post]] for deploying a private and public subnet on AWS using Terraform.
*** Planning:
I'll create this infrastructure copying the solution from the blog
word for word in a separate directory. After confirming that it works,
I'll note the differences between the working infrastructure and what
I had. Afterwards I'll use the notes to modify mine to comply with the
working one and hope it will be what's needed. From skimming the
document quickly, I guess that my problem was not adding the routing
table to the public subnet, but it might not be everything.

*** DONE Run and see if it works
CLOSED: [2023-06-20 Tue 12:44]
**** Strange error, looked like one line was "disappeared" in Emacs.
Terraform signaled an error of redefining type. This type of error
happens if we have a double definition of something that can only be
defined once.

I didn't see anything wrong in the file. Turning on the 'linum-mode'
in Emacs showed, that there was one line that "disappeared". Line 4
was right after the second line. I didn't investigate, just went to
the end of line 2 and held delete until I deleted the phantom line.
**** Had to add the ssh key uploading code.
I thought I can just link the name of the key uploaded by the flask
terraform code. It didn't work, maybe because 'terraform destroy'
destroys also SSH keys that are defined in the project. I just copied
what had to be copied and got the ssh-key name using terraform
variable substitution instead of the name I could get from AWS. Thanks
to writing out all the code I feel like I'm getting the hang of
Terraform. At least the hang of how things tend to be named and how to
get id's or inside-secret-names of things, using variables.



*** DONE Find the differences
CLOSED: [2023-06-22 Thu 18:17]
Differences were the routing table and routing table association.
*** DONE Add them to flask-ci-cd Terraform code.
CLOSED: [2023-06-23 Fri 15:42]
Added all networking infrastructure code to main.tf.

** TODO <<Create a file with secrets in the vault>>
*** Temporarily solved by having Terraform update Ansible's inventory file on each execution of 'terraform apply'.
*** We can keep some kind of state file there so that Terraform, Ansible and later Jenkins can communicate with each other or find out details on how to run the project.
*** File will be in bash, so that it can be sourced to read all the variables into memory.
*** To protect the secrets, a trap will be added to playtrough.sh script so that on script exit, the vault can be locked again.
*** Since vault starts as empty, we need to check if it(file with secrets)'s there and generate the file if it doesn't exist yet.

* DONE Set up Jenkins part 2: install Jenkins using Ansible.
CLOSED: [2023-08-04 Fri 21:44]

** DONE Create a Vagrant VM for local tests/development of the Jenkins playbook
CLOSED: [2023-08-02 Wed 13:54]
*** Reinstalled Vagrant because of libvirt plugin issues 
I've made the mistake of assuming that libvirt-devel package is going
to automatically pull libvirt. It's possible that reinstallation
wasn't necessary.
*** Installed & enabled libvirt and vagrant-libvirt plugin
*** Downloaded Alma Linux 9 vagrant box
*** Modified the default Vagrantfile based on previous projects (hostname, IP address, RAM)
*** Start an Apache server on the Vagrant machine to make sure everything works
I could see the test webpage after installing Apache and enabling it
in firewall.
** DONE Create a bash script or pseudocode script with the instructions listed in order.

CLOSED: [2023-08-02 Wed 13:54]
*** All this works and installs 
Jenkins, tho the Jenkins service had to be explicitly enabled/started
Firewall configuration might be even simpler - the Jenkins service is
most likely already defined in firewalld services.
** DONE Create a playbook based on the instructions
CLOSED: [2023-08-03 Thu 21:25]
** DONE Debug the playbook until it deploys a working Jenkins server
CLOSED: [2023-08-04 Fri 10:36]
*** There were issues with nearly each task in this short playbook. The way Ansible tasks are defined is very similar to bash, but it's not identical. I've also made a YAML newbie mistake of supplying a one-element list instead of a string.

** Automate uploading of the docker image either to AWS or Dockerhub
*** DONE Choose a deployment method: Decided to use AWS ECS with Fargate which is a very straightforward method of deploying a docker container to the cloud
CLOSED: [2023-09-20 Wed 10:08]
*** Read up documentation and tutorials:
**** AWS Docs: Building a serverless Jenkins environment on AWS Fargate https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/building-a-serverless-jenkins-environment-on-aws-fargate/
This is not exactly my use case, but it will be useful. It talks about
deploying Jenkins to ECS Fargate. But it includes info on temporary
credentials for 'AWS ECS Cluster access role' and 'Deployment role'. 
*** TODO Write Terraform code that deploys to the cloud, not worrying about secrets and permissions at first

** Test, debug and make sure it works with a manually set up Jenkins server
* Part 4: Configure Jenkins using JCasC
** Find out what needs to be done to use AWS permissions and secret store to give the least permissions required to have Jenkins auto deploy the container to ECS Fargate
** DONE Find some good sources on Jenkins as Code
   CLOSED: [2023-09-05 Tue 19:52]
*** Found both in Unix/Linux SysAdmin's Handbook (ULSAH):
**** jenkins pipeline as code
https://devopscube.com/jenkins-pipeline-as-code/

https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline-as-code/

Looks like the Pipeline as Code is a concept of creating a project
related Jenkins workflow, called a pipeline, defined in
code. Alternative would be to click it out in GUI, but having it in
code along with the project is more tidy. It's super popular.
**** jenkins configuration as code
Is a not-so-popular way to configure a Jenkins server, which then
needs another Pipeline as Code configuration to run jobs. It's not
that popular, but it's the way to go for an automated deployment.
** TODO Manually configure Jenkins
** DONE Update the Ansible playbook for Jenkins installation to include the JCasC plugin
CLOSED: [2023-09-16 Sat 13:41]
*** It wasn't easy because installing a plugin automatically on a new Jenkins installation can be challenging.
*** It seems that the most straightforward method would be to download the JCasC plugin on the Ansible host and then have Ansible push it to the server once it's up.
*** Ansible's 'wait_for' module waits for a port to open when an application starts up.
*** Got the JCasC plugin and it's dependencies packed neatly inside a .tgz file in the /jenkins_config directory
** Export the configuration in the JCasC format and create a new JCasC configuration based on that export
** Modify the Ansible playbook to place the configuration file on the Jenkins server
** Test, debug and make sure it works
* Part 5: Deploy the Flask web application to Amazon EKS
** Automate the deployment of the app when a new version of Dockerfile appears
** Test, debug and make sure it works
* TODO's (non mission-critical):
** Create a secret's file in the vault, as described [[Create a file with secrets in the vault][here]] in part 1 of the project.
** vault_management.sh (low priority, because using Hashicorp's Vault will make this script obsolete):
*** Vault management script could detect if container is already created/closed/open and not report an error if container state is already as requested.
*** Add an option to destroy the existing vault.
** playtrough.sh
*** If the variables in the vault are not set, interview the user about required project details at the beginning of the script.
*** DONE Both sub points can be achieved checking for presence of a dotfile.
CLOSED: [2023-06-15 Thu 13:50]
**** Test if script is run in the project's root directory
**** Test if the vault is already accessible
*** DONE Get password from a file or source other than user's input.
CLOSED: [2023-06-13 Tue 12:05]
If an environment variable with password is already defined,
playtrough.sh will not ask for the password.

*** Mention the opt-in to the Alma Linux AMI in playtrough.sh
 Error: creating EC2 Instance: OptInRequired: In order to use this AWS Marketplace product you need to accept terms and subscribe. To do so please visit https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp?sku=3kukoxmnoighcsbjd0u4nq9ds

**** Maybe it will be enough to warn the user? Would be cool to somehow force this subscription as one of the steps in the playtrough.sh. Maybe even test for it.

* Mistakes:
** Terraform:
*** Encapsulated a variable reference in double quotes, making it a literal string (effectively) turning off the reference mechanism.
#+BEGIN_SRC terraform
  provider "aws" {
    region = var.aws_region # Correct
    # region = "var.aws_region" # Incorrect
  }
#+END_SRC
** Using 'firewall-cmd' command without the '--permanent' option
It doesn't work.
** Defining variables for a group in Ansible's hosts.ini outside [GROUPNAME:vars] subsection (forgetting the ':vars' modificator)
I used just the [GROUPNAME], instead of this:
[aws:vars]
#ansible_user=ec2-user
ansible_user=vagrant
ansible_ssh_private_key_file="../vault/id_25519_aws_flaskcicd"

** Not refactoring the plan often enough. As we go deeper into the project, we gain knowledge and experience. In the light of newfound knowledge, the old plan becomes obsolete and should be replaced with more refined new plan. It doesn't mean that I was stupid by making the wrong plan in the beginning. Acting incompetently is the only way to gain competence to start acting competently.

**** Suggested requirements to run docker:
***** Docker Engine: This is the core component required to build Docker images. You don't need to run containers, but the Docker engine must be installed to execute the docker build command.

***** Docker CLI: This is typically bundled with the Docker Engine installation. It provides the command-line interface to interact with Docker, including building images.

***** Jenkins Docker Plugin (optional): While not strictly necessary if you're using shell commands in Jenkins to build images, the Docker plugin can provide better integration and additional features for Docker within Jenkins.

***** Appropriate Permissions: The user under which Jenkins is running needs to have permissions to interact with the Docker daemon. This is often achieved by adding the Jenkins user to the docker group.
**** Summary: steps taken:
***** Install CentOS docker repo:
$ sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
***** Remove conflicting packages preinstalled on AlmaLinux
sudo dnf remove podman buildah -y
***** Install docker packages
sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
***** Start docker service
sudo systemctl enable --now docker.service
***** Add jenkins (and vagrant) users to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
***** Install git package
***** Restart Jenkins service after changing the group.
