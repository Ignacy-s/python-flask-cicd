This is a simple CI/CD project to showcase my skills in ....

It's aim is for someone to be able to download this repository and run it
himself to create a working CI/CD pipeline in AWS based on Jenkins
that deploys a container with a flask web app to AWS each time a
commit is made to the tracked flask app repository. 


* Fork the simple Python Flask web application.
** Exploring tutor's choice of the app. Reading about Corey Schafer on his blog, https://coreyms.com
* Create a separate repository for Jenkins provisioning, installation, and configuration.
* Set up Jenkins part 1: setting up on AWS using Terraform.
* Set up Jenkins part 2: install Jenkins using Ansible.
* Set up Jenkins part 3: Configure Jenkins using JCasC
* Create a Jenkinsfile in the Flask web application repository
* Deploy the Flask web application
