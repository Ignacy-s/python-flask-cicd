This is a simple CI/CD project to showcase my skills in ....

It's aim is for someone to be able to download this repository and run it
himself to create a working CI/CD pipeline in AWS based on Jenkins
that deploys a container with a flask web app to AWS each time a
commit is made to the tracked flask app repository. 


* DONE Fork the simple Python Flask web application.
CLOSED: [2023-04-18 Tue 18:46]
** Exploring tutor's choice of the app. Reading about Corey Schafer on his blog, https://coreyms.com
This app was committed as a whole, with several distinct stages. I'm
going to use the stages as basis of separate commits for testing of
the pipeline and in the beginning only commit the first stage.

** Created a new repository, copied contents of the first chapter from Flask_Blog tutorial.
Flask Blog code found at [[https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Python/Flask_Blog][this address]].
Copied .gitignore from the CI/CD repo, but added the name of directory
with the original Corey's repo files, so they wont all get committed
at once.

* DONE Set up Jenkins part 1: setting up a VM on AWS using Terraform.
CLOSED: [2023-07-21 Fri 14:54]
** Create a data source that gets the AMI of the latest Alma Linux 9
** Create a base main.tf file that is a copy from the Terraform Up and Running code. Also add an alternative version that was given as an example of Jenkins setup on AWS.
** Add definitions for basic VPC and subnet
** Modify the basic security group definition to allow incoming traffic on ports 22 (for SSH) and 8080 (Jenkins web app)
** Move some values to variables to make code cleaner and reusable or usable by people who choose to use different AWS region
*** Move the port values to a variable and use variables instead.
*** Move the EC2 instance type to a variable (eu-north-1 region requires usage of a non standard t3 type server)
*** Move the region name to a variable.
** Create a script to create and open/close LUKS container (which can hold the SSH key).
** Write out pseudocode for a script that would execute the whole project.
** Put the initial steps (vault creation, SSH key generation and uploading and Jenkins VM spin up) into the playthrough script.
*** 1: Vault creation - done
*** 2: SSH key generation - done
*** 3: SSH key uploading & VM spin up - need to finish some things first:
**** Find a way to make the EC2 instance accessible from the internet (can't access it now if I'm creating my own subnet)
**** Find a way to pass the IP address of the EC2 instance to Ansible
** Had some issues with creating a VM accessible from the outside. Followed a blog article tutorial and succeeded, need to take what I learned there and put it in my Terraform code.
Following instructions in the [[https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-manage-public-and-private-subnets-in-aws-with-terraform-69c272003c81][blog post]] for deploying a private and public subnet on AWS using Terraform.
*** Planning:
I'll create this infrastructure copying the solution from the blog
word for word in a separate directory. After confirming that it works,
I'll note the differences between the working infrastructure and what
I had. Afterwards I'll use the notes to modify mine to comply with the
working one and hope it will be what's needed. From skimming the
document quickly, I guess that my problem was not adding the routing
table to the public subnet, but it might not be everything.

**** Strange error, looked like one line was "disappeared" in Emacs.
Terraform signaled an error of redefining type. This type of error
happens if we have a double definition of something that can only be
defined once.

I didn't see anything wrong in the file. Turning on the 'linum-mode'
in Emacs showed, that there was one line that "disappeared". Line 4
was right after the second line. I didn't investigate, just went to
the end of line 2 and held delete until I deleted the phantom line.
**** Had to add the ssh key uploading code.
I thought I can just link the name of the key uploaded by the flask
terraform code. It didn't work, maybe because 'terraform destroy'
destroys also SSH keys that are defined in the project. I just copied
what had to be copied and got the ssh-key name using terraform
variable substitution instead of the name I could get from AWS. Thanks
to writing out all the code I feel like I'm getting the hang of
Terraform. At least the hang of how things tend to be named and how to
get id's or inside-secret-names of things, using variables.



*** DONE Find the differences
CLOSED: [2023-06-22 Thu 18:17]
Differences were the routing table and routing table association.
*** DONE Add them to flask-ci-cd Terraform code.
CLOSED: [2023-06-23 Fri 15:42]
Added all networking infrastructure code to main.tf.

** TODO <<Create a file with secrets in the vault>>
*** Temporarily solved by having Terraform update Ansible's inventory file on each execution of 'terraform apply'.
*** We can keep some kind of state file there so that Terraform, Ansible and later Jenkins can communicate with each other or find out details on how to run the project.
*** File will be in bash, so that it can be sourced to read all the variables into memory.
*** To protect the secrets, a trap will be added to playthrough.sh script so that on script exit, the vault can be locked again.
*** Since vault starts as empty, we need to check if it(file with secrets)'s there and generate the file if it doesn't exist yet.

*** AWS Docs: Building a serverless Jenkins environment on AWS Fargate https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/building-a-serverless-jenkins-environment-on-aws-fargate/
This is not exactly my use case, but it will be useful. It talks about
deploying Jenkins to ECS Fargate. But it includes info on temporary
credentials for 'AWS ECS Cluster access role' and 'Deployment role'. 
*** Summary:
I need to start with a simple example of deploying a hello world to
ECS Fargate, then do it with Terraform (or maybe even start with
Terraform), then do it with Terraform from inside a Jenkinsfile and
lastly, do it from a Jenkinsfile with safely configured permissions
and credentials, so it can safely sit for a moment in the cloud.

This assumes we already have an ECR repo.
*** DONE Test the code on a local machine. Part 1: Create an ECR repo with Terraform
CLOSED: [2023-10-15 Sun 13:12]
Looks like we need to create the repo first. It's more straightforward
to use AWS CLI for this.
Need to remember that a local command assumes the default region from
the profile. A proper way would be to define the region explicitly in
the 'aws' command.

By mistake (I had 2 weeks break with the project) I've
started working on how to do the Terraform part of CI/CD. After
research, I've decided not to delay project further by learning on how
to use modules and just create separate Terraform projects in it's own
directories.

Since the hardest part of programming is done already (researching
available options, choosing the right alternatives, planning on how to
do things) and all that's left to crate an ECR repo with Terraform is
coding the solution, I'll skip the step of creating an ECR repo with
aws-cli.

Using the Terraform files from the Jenkins deployment as templates.

CLOSED: [2024-05-10 Fri 10:30]
There were issues with starting Jenkins after dropping the plugins in. Looks like it's not as easy as copying the files onto the server. Need to solve the problem in a different way - using Jenkins command line interface.
*** DONE Playbook should also install Terraform
CLOSED: [2024-06-02 Sun 19:49]
Instructions on [[https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli][Hashicorp's website]] for RHEL family Linux systems is pretty straightforward. It is also almost identical to how we install docker - add a repo and then install a package from that repo.
**** Had some issues with adding the hashicorp repo with ansible, but found out the reason through comparison with regular bash instructions for how to add the repo
**** While working on the above I've introduced another bug into the playbook, but successfully resolved it too.
When dividing long URLs (or strings in general) over two lines, you
need to remember to place a backslash at the end of the first (and
really each) line, if you want them to be later coalesced into one
string without any newlines.

Tested it on my development machine. Didn't want to put my secrets on
working servers until I find a secure way to handle them. Also, AWS
EC2 instances don't need the secrets, as they get authorized to deploy
into cloud with AIM policies. AIM - Amazon Identity Management.
**** DONE Running Jenkins pipeline to check if it can upload the image.

There was no Jenkins pipeline saved that would upload the image.
**** DONE Modify playbook to allow usage of Bitwarden and project's /bin scripts on Jenkins server
CLOSED: [2024-06-15 Sat 16:01]
Modified the playbook to do a sparse checkout on the project's repo
and copy downloaded scripts into /usr/local/bin so they can be easily
accessed. This solves the credentials problem, as we just run a script
that copies AWS credentials into environment variables, pulling them
via bitwarden-cli.
**** DONE Manually upload the image from docker, following the tutorial
CLOSED: [2024-06-19 Wed 10:28]
Had to manually create the ECR repo again, but it was just a matter of
cloning the app code repo and doing a `terraform init` and `terraform
apply`. Had to add vagrant user to the docker group.
Had to modify the repo name in the push-image-jenkinsless.sh script.
The name used to distinguish the repo differs between Terraform and
Docker.

** TODO Write Terraform code that deploys to the cloud, not worrying about secrets and permissions at first

** Put the Terraform code in a Jenkinsfile, maybe create few more steps, so that it's easier to see where exactly is the pipeline execution. Also use more descriptive names for steps, like 'Build Docker Image' instead of just 'Build'.
** Test, debug and make sure it works with a manually set up Jenkins server
** Find out what needs to be done to use AWS permissions and secret store to give the least permissions required to have Jenkins auto deploy the container to ECS Fargate

* Part 5: Configure Jenkins using JCasC
** DONE Find some good sources on Jenkins as Code
   CLOSED: [2023-09-05 Tue 19:52]
*** Found both in Unix/Linux SysAdmin's Handbook (ULSAH):
**** jenkins pipeline as code
https://devopscube.com/jenkins-pipeline-as-code/

https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline-as-code/

Looks like the Pipeline as Code is a concept of creating a project
related Jenkins workflow, called a pipeline, defined in
code. Alternative would be to click it out in GUI, but having it in
code along with the project is more tidy. It's super popular.
**** jenkins configuration as code
Is a not-so-popular way to configure a Jenkins server, which then
needs another Pipeline as Code configuration to run jobs. It's not
that popular, but it's the way to go for an automated deployment.
** TODO Manually configure Jenkins
** (Mistake - can't install plugins this way) Update the Ansible playbook for Jenkins installation to include the JCasC plugin
*** It wasn't easy because installing a plugin automatically on a new Jenkins installation can be challenging.
*** It seems that the most straightforward method would be to download the JCasC plugin on the Ansible host and then have Ansible push it to the server once it's up.
*** Ansible's 'wait_for' module waits for a port to open when an application starts up.
*** Got the JCasC plugin and it's dependencies packed neatly inside a .tgz file in the /jenkins_config directory
** Install a Jenkins plugin from a command line (without Ansible)
** Update playbook to install the JCasC plugin with Jenkins CLI
** Export the configuration in the JCasC format and create a new JCasC configuration based on that export
** Modify the Ansible playbook to place the configuration file on the Jenkins server
** Test, debug and make sure it works
* Part 6: Fully automate whole Jenkins deployment, configuration and pipeline setup using the 'playthrough.sh'
* TODO's (non mission-critical):
** Terraform
*** In Jenkins TF code - move variables into object and local variables
**** local variables
Not yet sure what should go there. But stuff like the port 0 or
protocol -1 or 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR block?
**** object variables
Make one object variable for VPC and one for Subnet and maybe one for
routing? Or maybe one big for networking? That could be too much.
** Create a secret's file in the vault, as described [[Create a file with secrets in the vault][here]] in part 1 of the project.
** vault_management.sh (low priority, because using Hashicorp's Vault will make this script obsolete):
*** Vault management script could detect if container is already created/closed/open and not report an error if container state is already as requested.
*** Add an option to destroy the existing vault.
** playthrough.sh
*** If the variables in the vault are not set, interview the user about required project details at the beginning of the script.
*** DONE Both sub points can be achieved checking for presence of a dotfile.
CLOSED: [2023-06-15 Thu 13:50]

**** Test if the vault is already accessible
*** DONE Get password from a file or source other than user's input.
CLOSED: [2023-06-13 Tue 12:05]
If an environment variable with password is already defined,
playthrough.sh will not ask for the password.

CLOSED: [2024-06-20 Thu 14:29]
It's not going to work with files with a different extension than
.org, but for now this is good enough.
* Mistakes:
** Terraform:
*** When testing Terraform configuration, running only Terraform Apply to test if it "compiles" - need to also test the IP address of the server
At some point I've introduced an error into my code, because I only
run `terraform destroy` and `terraform apply`. Without testing the
access to the server that was being set up.



*** Encapsulated a variable reference in double quotes, making it a literal string (effectively) turning off the reference mechanism.
#+BEGIN_SRC terraform
  provider "aws" {
    region = var.aws_region # Correct
    # region = "var.aws_region" # Incorrect
  }
#+END_SRC
** Using 'firewall-cmd' command without the '--permanent' option
It doesn't work.
** Ansible
*** Defining variables for a group in Ansible's hosts.ini outside [GROUPNAME:vars] subsection (forgetting the ':vars' modificator)
I used just the [GROUPNAME], instead of this:
[aws:vars]
#ansible_user=ec2-user
ansible_user=vagrant
ansible_ssh_private_key_file="../vault/id_25519_aws_flaskcicd"

*** Using a shell builtin with ansible command module - only the shell module has bash builtins.
** Not refactoring the plan often enough. As we go deeper into the project, we gain knowledge and experience. In the light of newfound knowledge, the old plan becomes obsolete and should be replaced with more refined new plan. It doesn't mean that I was stupid by making the wrong plan in the beginning. Acting incompetently is the only way to gain competence to start acting competently.
** Not reading up enough of previous documentation when coming back to project after a break. This led to duplicate work and thinking that the current task is more complicated than it was, in effect causing a longer delay in the project.
** Jenkins:
*** Tried to configure Jenkins the same way I once configured Icinga server in an automatic deployment - by dropping in configuration files from a preconfigured working server. Instead I should've looked for a more classic solution.
The right way to do it was through Jenkins CLI. I tried the drop in method to avoid learning how to use JCasC. If the plugin installation was that straightforward, I coul've finished the project without learning how to configure Jenkins with CLI (with the JCasC updating itself and installing other plugins from IaC).

*** DONE Preparing the Jenkins Controller Instance to also server as a Docker building agent (manually for now, but later need to modify the ansible and eventually JCasC configuration):

**** Suggested requirements to run docker:
***** Docker Engine: This is the core component required to build Docker images. You don't need to run containers, but the Docker engine must be installed to execute the docker build command.

***** Docker CLI: This is typically bundled with the Docker Engine installation. It provides the command-line interface to interact with Docker, including building images.

***** Jenkins Docker Plugin (optional): While not strictly necessary if you're using shell commands in Jenkins to build images, the Docker plugin can provide better integration and additional features for Docker within Jenkins.

***** Appropriate Permissions: The user under which Jenkins is running needs to have permissions to interact with the Docker daemon. This is often achieved by adding the Jenkins user to the docker group.
**** Summary: steps taken:
***** Install CentOS docker repo:
$ sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
***** Remove conflicting packages preinstalled on AlmaLinux
sudo dnf remove podman buildah -y
***** Install docker packages
sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
***** Start docker service
sudo systemctl enable --now docker.service
***** Add jenkins (and vagrant) users to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
***** Install git package
***** Restart Jenkins service after changing the group.

**** Summary: How do I need to modify my Ansible playbook?

Install repo: https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

Remove packages:
podman
buildah

Install packages:
bash-completion (for debugging and usability)
docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
git

Add jenkins user to docker group
!! jenkins service shouldn't be started before jenkins is added to the
docker group !!

Start and enable the docker.service


*** Writing the Jenkinsfile:
Shamelessly copying the example from the YouTube video.
*** Fixing agent to 'any' to allow building on the Jenkins controller
*** Installing git
