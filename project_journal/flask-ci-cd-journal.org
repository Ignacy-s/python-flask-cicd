First conversation with ChatGPT on the project.
** Write a step by step guide to create a most basic devops project to show in portfolio. Fully automated, using most popular technologies. It is just a simplest pipeline in jenkins or circleci. It should be deployed by cloning a git repo and running terraform. Before you start, ask questions about details with possible options and arguments for each choice. Only generate the step by step guide after you have all required data.
*** Before creating the step-by-step guide for your basic DevOps project, I need some clarification on a few details. Please provide information on the following:

    Programming language: Which programming language is used for the application you want to build?
    Application type: Is it a web application, a command-line tool, or something else?
    Source code repository: Which Git hosting platform do you prefer (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)?
    Infrastructure provider: On which cloud provider or platform do you want to deploy your application (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean)?
    Target environment: Do you want to deploy to a specific environment like Kubernetes, or just to a virtual machine or container?

Once I have this information, I will provide you with a tailored
step-by-step guide for creating a basic DevOps project for your
portfolio.
** A.D. 1. I don't know, I would like something simple. In a later project version, we can use something more complicated. Please give me some options for a most basic project. Maybe some open source web app?
A.D. 2. I would like it to be a web app, that we would also deploy to
a web server using terraform and ansible/bash.
A.D. 3. GitHub,
A.D. 4. AWS A.D. 5. Virtual machine for CI/CD and container/VM for
webapp.

Remember it's a CV project. It should ask the person running it for
all credentials required to deploy to AWS, or take it from some
credentials file.
*** Thank you for providing the necessary details. Based on your preferences, I suggest using a simple Python Flask web application as the base project for your portfolio. Here's the step-by-step guide for creating a basic DevOps project:

    Fork a simple Python Flask web application:
    Go to https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Python/Flask_Blog and fork the repository to your GitHub account.

    Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/code_snippets.git
cd code_snippets/Python/Flask_Blog

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Test the application locally:

arduino

export FLASK_APP=flaskblog.py
flask run

Open your browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 to view the web application.

Set up a Jenkins instance on AWS using Terraform and Ansible:

    Create a jenkins_setup directory and change into it:

    bash

        mkdir jenkins_setup
        cd jenkins_setup

        Create a main.tf file for Terraform configuration and add the necessary AWS resources (VPC, subnet, security group, and EC2 instance). Use the Amazon Linux 2 AMI and install Jenkins on the EC2 instance using user_data.
        Create an Ansible playbook (jenkins_playbook.yml) to install Jenkins and its dependencies, like Java and Git, on the EC2 instance.
        Set up AWS credentials by providing your access key and secret key either through environment variables or the ~/.aws/credentials file.
        Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform working directory.
        Run terraform apply to create the infrastructure on AWS.
        Once the EC2 instance is up and running, use ansible-playbook to run the jenkins_playbook.yml file.

    Configure Jenkins:
        Access the Jenkins instance using the public IP address of the created EC2 instance.
        Unlock Jenkins using the initial admin password found in /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword.
        Install the recommended plugins and set up an admin user.

    Create a Jenkins pipeline:
        In Jenkins, create a new pipeline job.
        In the pipeline configuration, select "Pipeline script from SCM" and provide the GitHub repository URL and credentials.
        Add a Jenkinsfile to the root of the Flask web application repository with the following stages:
            Checkout: Clone the repository.
            Build: Set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies.
            Test: Run unit tests, if any.
            Deploy: Use a Dockerfile to containerize the application, push the Docker image to a container registry, and deploy the application to a container platform like Amazon ECS or a VM using Ansible.

    Trigger the Jenkins pipeline:
        Manually trigger the pipeline by clicking "Build Now" in Jenkins.
        Optionally, set up a webhook on GitHub to automatically trigger the pipeline whenever new changes are pushed to the repository.

    Access the deployed web application using the URL or public IP address of the target environment (e.g., Amazon ECS or the VM).

Now you have a fully automated DevOps project that showcases your
ability to create a CI/CD pipeline using popular technologies like
Jenkins, Terraform, and Ansible.
** The deployment of the CI/CD should be fully automated, configuring Jenkins by hand wont do. Maybe you have to use CircleCI to be able to have CI/CD configuration in YAML format?
*** You're correct. CircleCI allows you to store your CI/CD configuration in a YAML file, which simplifies the automation process. Here's the updated step-by-step guide for creating a basic DevOps project using CircleCI, Terraform, and Ansible:

    Fork the simple Python Flask web application:
    Follow the same steps as mentioned earlier to fork and clone the Flask web application.

    Sign up for CircleCI and connect your GitHub account:
        Go to https://circleci.com/signup/ and sign up using your GitHub account.
        Once logged in, add your forked Flask web application repository by clicking on "Add Projects" and selecting your repository.

    Create a CircleCI configuration file in your repository:
    In the root of the Flask web application repository, create a .circleci directory, and inside it, create a config.yml file with the following configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml

version: 2.1
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.8
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Set up virtual environment
          command: |
            python -m venv venv
            . venv/bin/activate
      - run:
          name: Install dependencies
          command: |
            . venv/bin/activate
            pip install -r requirements.txt
  deploy:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.8
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Set up virtual environment
          command: |
            python -m venv venv
            . venv/bin/activate
      - run:
          name: Install dependencies
          command: |
            . venv/bin/activate
            pip install -r requirements.txt
      - setup_remote_docker
      - run:
          name: Build and push Docker image
          command: |
            echo "$DOCKER_PASSWORD" | docker login -u "$DOCKER_USERNAME" --password-stdin
            docker build -t <your_dockerhub_username>/flask-webapp:latest .
            docker push <your_dockerhub_username>/flask-webapp:latest
      - run:
          name: Deploy to AWS
          command: |
            . venv/bin/activate
            ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory.ini ansible/deploy.yml
workflows:
  version: 2
  build-and-deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - build
          filters:
            branches:
              only: main
#+END_SRC


Set up environment variables in CircleCI:

    Go to your project's settings in CircleCI.
    Under "Environment Variables", add the following variables:
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Your AWS access key.
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Your AWS secret key.
        DOCKER_USERNAME: Your Docker Hub username.
        DOCKER_PASSWORD: Your Docker Hub password.

Create an Ansible playbook for deployment:

    In the repository, create an ansible directory.
    Inside the ansible directory, create the following files:
        inventory.ini: A file containing the target AWS EC2 instance for deployment.
        deploy.yml: The main Ansible playbook to deploy the Docker container to the target instance.

The deploy.yml file should include tasks for:

    Installing Docker on the target instance.
    Logging in to Docker Hub.
    Pulling the latest Docker image of your Flask web application.
    Running a Docker container with the pulled image.

Set up AWS infrastructure using Terraform:
Follow the same
** Is it possible to make it even simpler? CircleCI requires logging in. Maybe it's possible to have jenkins configuration saved in a file and have jenkins load this configuration from repo? Maybe use a separate repo for the jenkins provisioning and installation and configuration?
*** I apologize for the confusion. Here's the complete step-by-step guide for creating a basic DevOps project using Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC), Terraform, and Ansible:

    Fork the simple Python Flask web application:
        Go to https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Python/Flask_Blog and fork the repository to your GitHub account.
        Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

        bash

    git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/code_snippets.git
    cd code_snippets/Python/Flask_Blog

Create a separate repository for Jenkins provisioning, installation, and configuration:

    On GitHub, create a new repository called jenkins_config.
    Clone the new repository on your local machine:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/jenkins_config.git
    cd jenkins_config

Set up Jenkins on AWS using Terraform and Ansible:

    Create a jenkins_setup directory and change into it:

    bash

mkdir jenkins_setup
cd jenkins_setup

Create a main.tf file for Terraform configuration and add the necessary AWS resources (VPC, subnet, security group, and EC2 instance). Use the Amazon Linux 2 AMI and install Jenkins on the EC2 instance using user_data.
Create an Ansible playbook (jenkins_playbook.yml) to install Jenkins and its dependencies, like Java, Git, and the JCasC plugin, on the EC2 instance:

yaml

    - name: Install Jenkins and dependencies
      hosts: all
      become: yes
      vars:
        jenkins_plugins:
          - name: git
          - name: configuration-as-code
      tasks:
        - name: Install Java
          package:
            name: java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
            state: present

        - name: Add Jenkins repository
          yum_repository:
            name: jenkins
            description: Jenkins Repository
            baseurl: http://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo
            gpgkey: https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key
            gpgcheck: yes

        - name: Install Jenkins
          package:
            name: jenkins
            state: present

        - name: Start and enable Jenkins service
          systemd:
            name: jenkins
            state: started
            enabled: yes

        - name: Install Jenkins plugins
          jenkins_plugin:
            name: "{{ item.name }}"
          with_items: "{{ jenkins_plugins }}"

    Set up AWS credentials by providing your access key and secret key either through environment variables or the ~/.aws/credentials file.
    Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform working directory.
    Run terraform apply to create the infrastructure on AWS.
    Once the EC2 instance is up and running, use ansible-playbook to run the jenkins_playbook.yml file.

Configure Jenkins using JCasC:

    In the jenkins_config repository, create a jenkins.yaml file for Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC).
    Add the following configuration to create a pipeline job:

    yaml

jobs:
  - script: >
      pipelineJob('flask-webapp') {
        definition {
          cpsScm {
            scm {
              git {
                remote { url('https://github.com/<your_github_username>/code_snippets.git') }
                branches('master')
              }
            }
            scriptPath
** How could the Jenkins provisioning (`jenkins_playbook.yml`) playbook be modified to also install the Jenkins config from the `jenkins.yml` file?
*** To modify the jenkins_playbook.yml to install the Jenkins config from the jenkins.yaml file, you can add a few tasks to the Ansible playbook. These tasks will clone the jenkins_config repository, copy the jenkins.yaml file to the JCasC configuration directory, and restart Jenkins to apply the changes.

Here's the updated jenkins_playbook.yml:

yaml

- name: Install Jenkins and dependencies
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  vars:
    jenkins_plugins:
      - name: git
      - name: configuration-as-code
  tasks:
    - name: Install Java
      package:
        name: java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
        state: present

    - name: Add Jenkins repository
      yum_repository:
        name: jenkins
        description: Jenkins Repository
        baseurl: http://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo
        gpgkey: https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key
        gpgcheck: yes

    - name: Install Jenkins
      package:
        name: jenkins
        state: present

    - name: Start and enable Jenkins service
      systemd:
        name: jenkins
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Install Jenkins plugins
      jenkins_plugin:
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
      with_items: "{{ jenkins_plugins }}"

    - name: Clone Jenkins configuration repository
      git:
        repo: https://github.com/<your_github_username>/jenkins_config.git
        dest: /var/lib/jenkins/jenkins_config

    - name: Ensure JCasC configuration directory exists
      file:
        path: /var/lib/jenkins/configuration-as-code
        state: directory
        owner: jenkins
        group: jenkins
        mode: '0755'

    - name: Copy Jenkins configuration file
      copy:
        src: /var/lib/jenkins/jenkins_config/jenkins.yaml
        dest: /var/lib/jenkins/configuration-as-code/jenkins.yaml
        owner: jenkins
        group: jenkins
        mode: '0644'

    - name: Restart Jenkins to apply configuration changes
      systemd:
        name: jenkins
        state: restarted

These new tasks perform the following actions:

    Clone the jenkins_config repository to /var/lib/jenkins/jenkins_config on the Jenkins EC2 instance.
    Ensure that the JCasC configuration directory /var/lib/jenkins/configuration-as-code exists.
    Copy the jenkins.yaml file from the cloned repository to the JCasC configuration directory.
    Restart Jenkins to apply the configuration changes.

After running the updated playbook, Jenkins will load the
configuration from the jenkins.yaml file located in the JCasC
configuration directory.

** Preparing org-style plan for what needs to be done.
Offtop: My eyes hurt a little and vision is blurry again, think it's because some of the under-eyes cream got into the eyes.
*** It's easier to follow the instructions in ChatGPT web app than what's copied into the org document. Might be because the numbered list doesn't get copied correctly (it's copied without the numbers).
*** Going to use the basic 6 steps from the prompt as the first level tasks for the org document.
*** For now leaving it with just 6 steps, will plan each step as I approach it.

** Copying the code snippets from ChatGPT into one organized place.
*** Code is already in this org file. I've made screenshots of the whole conversation in case I need some more organized reference.
** Moved the journal to another file, so it can be removed from the repo if it's required.
At first thought to remove it completely from git tracking. Then I
would lose the advantage of having notes and thoughts connected with
specific code changes in one place.

After thinking deeper, I realized that I wanted to hide the fact that
I used ChatGPT to help me decide on what project to choose for MVP
DevOps project for most basic portfolio of one. But after considering
it, I've realized that the only thing that would be dishonest here
would be trying to hide that I got help from a ChatGPT tutor.

** A problem needs solving before I start work. This project calls for usage of two more repositories, while I like to have one big repo that also includes the journal files. Maybe if I could explain the situation verbosely enough to ChatGPT, it could have some insights. I'm using the same conversation as for the whole project, so I assume that ChatGPT has context enough for this question (i.e. I don't have to tell it about the project).
You are a tutor, Senior DevOps expert helping me, aiming for a Junior
DevOps position, by giving me guidance and assistance where I need it.


I like to work by writing a project journal with general thoughts and
notes on what I'm doing and why I'm doing it, and also a project
documentation with more specific information on steps performed when
working on a project with details on each step so it can be understood
later on. Because of that I tended to have one big repository for both
the code and journals, so commits with code also include journal
commits, which gives each code commit much more context.

This project however requires usage of two more repositories. One for
Jenkins deployment and Configuration. Second one being the cloned
repository of the flask web app.

Later web app maintenance is not a concern. Readability is, but even
more important is to not make the project too complicated, so I can
finish it quickly. It's just a portfolio project to showcase basic
DevOps skills, so I can have something to link from the CV.

What should I do?
I see three options, but maybe you have other insights:

Option one: Create just one big repo, with the two other repos not
really repos but directories inside the big repo. It will make work on
the 'Jenkins deployment and configuration' part much easier, as each
code commit will also be accompanied by relevant journal entries. It
will also make it near-impossible to have CI/CD pipeline triggered on
new commits, since the commits will be not only to the cloned flask
app, but also to CI/CD configuration and deployment.

Option two: Create one big repo, and then somehow create two others
inside it. I'm not sure if it's possible with git. It might cause
problems later on, but as long as basic deployment of the CI/CD
pipeline is possible, it should be ok. However, I'm not shy of sharing
these journals publicly.

Option three: Create three separate repos in three separate directory
trees. One for journals and files specific to the whole project,
second for CI/CD deployment and configuration, third for the web
app. This means that repos will not disturb each other, but also that
the journal entries wont be connected with code commits, so I can't
show my thought process and can't easily see documentation entries
connected to code entries.

Option four (idea I had while writing down previous options): Have two
repos. First one would merge the repo for the project as a whole and
the CI/CD pipeline. Showcasing CI/CD skills is at the heart of the
project. The second repo with the cloned web app repository could
include just the web app (and eventually some CI/CD configuration that
would normally reside in the same repo as the app). Then commits to
this separate repo could properly trigger build and deployment process
from Jenkins.

*** Based on your requirements and priorities, I suggest going with Option Four. This option strikes a balance between simplicity and showcasing your DevOps skills, while also allowing you to maintain your project journal alongside the code.

Here's a breakdown of Option Four:

    Create a main repository for the project documentation, journal, and CI/CD pipeline configuration. This repository will include the following directories and files:
        /project_journal - for your project journal and general thoughts.
        /project_documentation - for your project documentation with step-by-step details.
        /jenkins_config - for Jenkins provisioning, installation, and configuration.
        /terraform - for your Terraform configuration files.
        /ansible - for your Ansible playbooks.

    Fork the Flask web application repository and clone it. This will serve as your second repository. You can add the required CI/CD configuration files (such as Jenkinsfile) directly to this repository. This will allow Jenkins to trigger builds and deployments based on commits to this repository.

This way, you can have your project journal and documentation connected to the CI/CD pipeline configuration and deployment, while keeping the web application repository separate. The separation ensures that your CI/CD pipeline works as expected, and it demonstrates your ability to create and manage a basic DevOps project for your portfolio.

Remember to update the paths in your CI/CD pipeline configuration and
scripts to point to the correct directories in your new repository
structure.

*** Comment: Just describing the problem well let me have an insight on how to solve it. I wonder if some of the power of large language models doesn't lie in the rubberducking nature of using them. Rubber-ducking is a process of troubleshooting a problem by first describing it thoroughly to a rubber duck before we go and ask other people about it. What's special about it, is that just by talking and explaining the problem to a rubber duck, or any imaginary entity, we often arrive at solutions to our problems.

** After deciding on how project will look (including repos and such), I'm preparing the first commit that will include basic directory structure, but also contain project's description. Actually I'm going to cut a corner here and have ChatGPT generate project's description.
*** Create a project description to be included at the beginning of project documentation file. It is to be read by people checking out the portfolio. You can base it on this:

This is a simple CI/CD project to showcase my skills in ....

It's aim is for someone to be able to download this repository and run it
himself to create a working CI/CD pipeline in AWS based on Jenkins
that deploys a container with a flask web app to AWS each time a
commit is made to the tracked flask app repository.
**** Title: Basic DevOps Portfolio Project - CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins and AWS
Project Description:

Welcome to my Basic DevOps Portfolio Project. The primary goal of this project is to showcase my skills in setting up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins, AWS, and containerization.

In this project, you will find a fully functional CI/CD pipeline that automates the process of deploying a Flask web application to an AWS environment each time a commit is made to the tracked repository. The pipeline is designed to be easily reproducible, allowing you to download this repository and set up the pipeline in your own AWS account with minimal effort.

The project highlights my proficiency in:

    Jenkins: Configuring and managing Jenkins as a CI/CD tool, including setting up jobs, pipelines, and plugins.
    AWS: Leveraging various AWS services, such as EC2, RDS, and ECS, to create a scalable and secure infrastructure for the web application.
    Terraform: Using Terraform to define and provision the infrastructure resources required for the pipeline and the web application.
    Ansible/Bash: Automating the deployment and configuration of the Jenkins server, as well as the web application, using Ansible playbooks or Bash scripts.
    Containerization: Packaging the Flask web application in a Docker container to ensure consistent deployment across environments.

By following the detailed instructions provided in this project documentation, you will be able to create a working CI/CD pipeline in your own AWS account, gaining a deeper understanding of the processes and tools involved in modern DevOps practices.
**** Comment: Description generated by GPT-4 is flawless. Why I feel uneasy about it then? For a Junior engineer it's important to do things yourself, that's the only way to learn them. I guess in places that are not a core ability for a DevOps, cutting corners like that may be essential to work against my tendency to over complicate things and to fall into rabbit holes. On the other hand, if I'm doing something that I later want to say I can do as a professional, I might use ChatGPT as a web search or a guide on what to do next or how to solve a problem, but not to get a complete solution that I would mindlessly copy. Still, there is a certain knowledge required to use these solutions correctly and to spot when ChatGPT is hallucinating. So I shouldn't accredit all work to ChatGPT either.

** Just posting this project description would make me feel weak inside. How can I use it and still have clean conscience? By adding a note that it was written by ChatGPT and also informing potential readers that ChatGPT assisted in planning the project and writing parts of the documentation. Maybe just a general info in the project description, and then specific notes in places where ChatGPT does most of the work, like in the project description? This feels good. I have a feeling that this kind of ethical questions is what many people ask themselves at the moment. Problem in my case is that if I just had ChatGPT do 90% of the work in every aspect, it would be insincere to claim that I've done the work or that it shows any skills on my part other than prompt engineering.
** I should explicitly say in the project's readme (which can be just a .md version of project description from the documentation .org file) what ChatGPT helped with.
